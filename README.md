# From-Metrics-to-Meaning 🎯
Part 6 of Analytical Think Pieces

When Data Stops Speaking — And How to Listen Again  

We live in dashboards. But when data stops aligning with real outcomes, we enter **Decision Drift** — chasing noise, losing narrative.  

| Drift Signal | What It Looks Like | Data Fix |
|:--|:--|:--|
| Over-tracking | Too many KPIs, no direction | Reduce metrics to Top 5 |
| Misaligned Focus | Metrics ≠ Mission | Re-anchor goals quarterly |
| Human Blind Spot | Ignoring qualitative feedback | Add voice-of-team metrics |

Sometimes, analytics must pause for *human calibration*.  
Listen to the data — and then listen beyond it.  


✨ **Takeaway:** Clarity isn’t found in more data; it’s found in aligned data.
